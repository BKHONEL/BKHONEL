# 👋 Hi, I'm Khonel!

🔧 Programmer | 🔍 Reverse Engineer (Software & Hardware) | 🛡 Cybersecurity Enthusiast | 🧠 Prompt Engineer

Hey there, welcome to my GitHub!
I'm Petra — a self-taught programmer and reverse engineer from Indonesia. I love exploring how things work by breaking and rebuilding software and hardware. Whether it’s reverse engineering old software, dumping firmware from embedded devices, or building tools with Visual Basic, Python, C++, and .NET, I’m always experimenting with code.

For the past 3+ years, I’ve been deep into software development, cracking apps, writing custom keygens, and even working on AI prompt engineering for video and voice sync tools. If you're into low-level debugging, firmware hacking, or just curious about what makes programs tick — you’re in the right place.
